This repository contains the relevant files for the completion of the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" project, week 4. In the preparation of tidy data that can be used for later analysis; and in addition to this README.md, the following files are presented:  

##### 1. run_analysis.R

* the R-coding following these stages, as set out in the instructions:

    * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##### 2. CodeBook.md 

* including descriptions of the tidies data indicating all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

##### 3. TidyDataSet.txt
