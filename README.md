### Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project: A Peer-Graded Assignment

This repository contains the relevant files for the completion of the Coursera 
"Getting and Cleaning Data" project, week 4. In preparing the provided [Human 
Activity Recognition Using Smartphones data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
to tidy for later analysis; and in addition to this README.md, the following 
files are presented:

***
##### 1. run_analysis.R

* the R-coding following these stages after downloading and preparing the data, 
as set out in the main [project instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project):

    * Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each 
      measurement.
    * Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    * Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
    * From the data set in step 4, a second independent tidy data set with the 
      average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##### 2. CodeBook.md 

* includes descriptions of the tidied data indicating the variables and 
summaries calculated, along with units; and any other relevant information.

##### 3. TidyDataSet.txt

* a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each
